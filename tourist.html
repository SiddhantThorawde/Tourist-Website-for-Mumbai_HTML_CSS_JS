				The <strong>Haji Ali Dargah</strong>,is a mosque and dargah (tomb)
				located on an islet off the coast of <strong>Worli</strong> in the
				southern part of Mumbai. Near the heart of the city proper, the dargah
				is one of the most recognisable landmarks of Mumbai. An exquisite
				example of Indo-Islamic Architecture, associated with legends about
				doomed lovers, the dargah contains the tomb of
				<strong>Sayed Peer Haji Ali Shah Bukhari</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Haji Ali Dargah was constructed in 1431 in memory of a wealthy
				Muslim merchant, Sayyed Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, who gave up all his
				worldly possessions before making a pilgrimage to Mecca. Hailing from
				Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan, Bukhari travelled around the world
				in the early to mid 15th century, and eventually settled in
				present-day Mumbai.

				<strong>Jijabai Bhonsale Udyan,</strong> also known as the
				<strong>Byculla Zoo</strong> and formerly Victoria Gardens, is a zoo
				and garden covering 50 acres located at Byculla, in the heart of
				Mumbai, India. It is the oldest public garden in Mumbai. After Indian
				independence it was Named after Jijamata, the mother of Shivaji , the
				first Maratha emperor. <br /><br />

				In 1835, British administration granted a large plot of land in Sewri
				to the Agro Horticultural Society of Western India for a botanical
				garden known as Victoria Gardens after Queen-Empress Victoria. That
				land was later acquired for a European burial ground. In 1861,
				construction of a new garden was commenced on 33 acres in the Mount
				Estate, Mazgaon (now included in Byculla). The flora from Sewri garden
				was transferred to this new garden named Jijamata Udyaan which was
				formally opened to the public by Lady Frere on 19 November 1862. Agro
				Horticultural Society of Western India continued to maintain Victoria
				Gardens till 1873 when the society's end led to the municipal
				corporation taking over the garden's upkeep. In 1890 the garden was
				extended by 15 acres especially for the zoo. <br /><br />

				The garden also houses the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum, a staff building
				in Greco-Roman style erected in the memory of Lady Frere, an
				equestrian statue of King Edward VII of England made of black marble
				(originally installed near the University of Mumbai) known as Kala
				Ghoda and the David Sassoon clock tower.

				<strong>Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP)</strong>, formerly
				<strong>Borivali National Park</strong>, is a large protected area in
				the northern part of Mumbai city (preferably called Mumbai Suburban
				district) in Maharashtra State in India. It encompasses an area of
				<strong>104 km<sup>2</sup> (40 sq mi)</strong> and is surrounded on
				three sides by India's most populous city. It is notable as one of the
				major national parks existing within a metropolis limit and is one of
				the most visited parks in the world.<br /><br />

				The Sanjay Gandhi National Park area has a long written history dating
				back to the 4th century BCE. In ancient India, Sopara and Kalyan were
				two ports in the vicinity that traded with ancient civilisations such
				as Greece and Mesopotamia. The 45 km (28 mi) land route between these
				two ports was partially through this forest.<br /><br />

				The Kanheri Caves in the centre of the park were an important Buddhist
				learning centre and pilgrimage site sculpted by Buddhist monks between
				the 9th and the 1st centuries BCE. They were chiselled out of a
				massive basaltic rock outcropping.

				<strong>Marine Drive</strong> is a 3.6-kilometre-long boulevard in

				<i>late philanthropist</i> <strong>Bhagojisheth Keer</strong> &
				<strong>Pallonji Mistry</strong>. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete
				road along the coast, which is a natural bay. The road links Nariman
				Point to Babulnath and Malabar Hill. Marine Drive is situated over
				reclaimed land facing west-south-west. A promenade lies parallel to
				this road. Marine Drive is also known as the
				<strong>Queen's Necklace</strong> because, if viewed at night from an
				elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a
				string of pearls in a necklace. <br><br>
				The official name for this road, though rarely used, is <strong>Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
					Road.</strong> The promenade
				is lined with palm trees. At the northern end of Marine Drive is <strong>Chowpatty Beach.</strong> This
				is a popular
				beach famed for its <strong>Puri (local fast food).</strong> Many restaurants also line this stretch of
				the road.
				Further down this road lies Walkeshwar, a wealthy neighborhood of the city, also home to <strong>the

				The <strong>Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati Mandir</strong> is a Hindu
				temple dedicated to <strong>Lord Shri Ganesh</strong>. It is located
				in <strong>Prabhadevi, Mumbai, Maharashtra</strong>. It was originally
				built by <strong>Laxman Vithu</strong> and
				<strong>Deubai Patil</strong> on <strong>19 November 1801</strong>. It
				is one of the richest temples in Mumbai. The inner roof of the sanctum
				is plated with gold, and the central statue is of Ganesha. Temple
				glory was bought not only by the politicians who frequented the temple
				but also <strong>Bollywood film stars</strong> who continuously visit
				to seek the blessings of Lord Ganesha. Apple CEO
				<strong>Tim Cook</strong> began his 2016 India trip with morning
				prayers at the temple. Siddhivinayak is well known as
				<strong>"Navasacha Ganapati"</strong> or
				<strong>"Navasala Pavanara Ganapati"</strong> ('Ganapati bestows
				whenever humbly genuinely prayed a wish' in Marathi) among devotees. <br><br>
				The temple has a small mandap with the shrine for Siddhi Vinayak ("Ganesha who grants your wish"). The
				wooden doors to the sanctum are carved with images of the Ashtavinayak (the eight manifestations of
				Ganesha in Maharashtra). The inner roof of the sanctum is plated with gold, and the central statue is of
				Ganesha. In the periphery, there is a Hanuman temple as well. The exterior of the temple consists of a
				dome which is lit up with multiple colors in the evenings and they keep changing every few hours. The
				statue of Shri Ganesha is located exactly under the dome.
